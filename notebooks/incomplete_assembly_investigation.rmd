# Introduction

Having analysed assemblies' summaries I found out that a lot of them (n=89) are incomplete, i.e. not circularised by Unicycler.
One possible reason can be that they were trimmed to harshly by *filtlong*.

![Fig.1 Assembly completeness as reported by Unicycler](../images/assembly_completeness_barplot.png)

I have a table with incomplete assemblies
```{r}
library(dplyr)

# just in case
my_path <- "/home/andrei/Data/HeteroR/results/assemblies_joined"

summary_files <- dir(path=my_path,  pattern = "summary.tsv", recursive=TRUE)
summary_table <- lapply(summary_files, function(x){read.delim(paste0("../results/assemblies_joined/", x), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)})

summary_table <- bind_rows(summary_table)
# replace commas in Length, N50 and Longest component
summary_table$Length <- as.integer(gsub(",", "", summary_table$Length, fixed=TRUE))
summary_table$N50 <- as.integer(gsub(",", "", summary_table$N50, fixed=TRUE))
summary_table$Longest_component <- as.integer(gsub(",", "", summary_table$Longest_component, fixed=TRUE))

write.delim(summary_table %>% filter(Status == "incomplete"), sep="\t", quote=F)

incomplete_assemblies <- read.delim("/home/andrei/Data/HeteroR/incomplete_assemblies.tsv")
incomplete_assemblies
```

Then I ran *coverage.py* on both raw and filtered Nanopore reads in hope to capture the difference...

```
python  workflow/scripts/coverage.py resources/strain_lists/incomplete_assemblies_strains_80.txt 5131220 results/coverage/incomplete_assemblies_strains_80_coverage.tsv raw
python  workflow/scripts/coverage.py resources/strain_lists/incomplete_assemblies_strains_80.txt 5131220 results/coverage/incomplete_assemblies_strains_80_coverage_filtered.tsv filtered
```

Let's look at results

```{r}
coverage_raw <- read.delim("/home/andrei/Data/HeteroR/results/coverage/incomplete_assemblies_strains_80_coverage.tsv")
coverage_raw$strain <- sapply(coverage_raw$file, function(x){strsplit(x, "/")[[1]][3]})
coverage_raw$filtered <- "no"

coverage_filtered <- read.delim("/home/andrei/Data/HeteroR/results/coverage/incomplete_assemblies_strains_80_coverage_filtered.tsv")
coverage_filtered$strain <- sapply(coverage_filtered$file, function(x){strsplit(x, "/")[[1]][3]})
coverage_filtered <- select(coverage_filtered, -c(file, format, type))
coverage_filtered$filtered <- "yes"

coverage_joined <- bind_rows(coverage_raw, coverage_filtered)
coverage_joined <- select(coverage_joined, -c(file, format, type))
coverage_joined
```

# Plots

## Number of sequences

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(coverage_joined, aes(strain, num_seqs))+
         geom_col(aes(fill=filtered), position="dodge")+
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90))

#+coord_trans(y="sqrt")
```

## Coverage

```{r}
ggplot(coverage_joined, aes(strain, coverage))+
         geom_col(aes(fill=filtered), position="dodge")+
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90))

```
